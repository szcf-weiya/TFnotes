## Your CPU supports instructions that this TensorFlow binary was not compiled to use: SSE4.1 SSE4.2 AVX AVX2 FMA

This isn't an error, just warnings saying if you build TensorFlow from source it can be faster on your machine.

refer to [How to compile tensorflow using SSE4.1, SSE4.2, and AVX.](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/8037)
